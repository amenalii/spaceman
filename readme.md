# **Spaceman** - Online Web Game 

## About the Game
Spaceman is an online web based game which is similair to hangman but with a space themed twist. In the game, players must guess a hidden word represented by dashes on the screen. Using the on-screen keyboard, they can guess one letter at a time. Correct guesses reveal the letters in the word, while incorrect guesses count against them.

> Fun Fact: I decided to make this game because I love word puzzles and have always been fascinated by space.
